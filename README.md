<h1>EARLY WIP SMO ROUTING TOOL (IN COLLABORATION WITH DANSTA)</h1>

This is basically a web simulator of Super Mario Odyssey in which you will be able to click through all kinds of collectables and events like in the original game.
This will be usable to test/verify routes faster than ever before!

<h2>Current features</h2>

-Play through every moon in the base game (any%)

-Select and deselect moons and view your global game state

-Accurately simulate moon unlock requirements like in the original game

-It is not yet possible to freely go around kingdoms. You can only play in the kingdom order of the any% route and not go back to a previous kingdom.

<h2>Coming soon (or eventually (hopefully))</h2>

-Play through the entire game up to 100%

-Sandbox mode: select any kingdom at any time with their different scenarios

-Handle other relevant game events (talking to NPCs, collecting purple coins etc.)

-And much more!
